Heegaard builder
----------------

This repository contains source code for building one-vertex 3-manifold
triangulations from a combinatorial encoding of a Heegaard diagram called
a Heegaard bouquet.

The algorithm for building such triangulations was designed in joint work
with James Morgan and Em Thompson. The main implementation for this
algorithm is contained in the script ``heegaardbuilder.py``. This script
is designed to be run using Regina's regina-python command-line program in
interactive mode. For details on how to install Regina, visit:
    https://regina-normal.github.io/.
See ``heegaardExample.txt`` for a transcript of a regina-python session
using ``heegaardbuilder.py``.
