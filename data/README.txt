Experimental data
-----------------

This directory contains data for triangulations of prime 3-manifolds
generated by starting with a layered handlebody, and attaching another
handlebody according to a filling bouquet. We generated filling bouquets by
enumerating edge weight vectors up to a certain total weight (i.e., up to a
certain number of intersections between the filling bouquet and the
1-skeleton of the layered handlebody). To keep the quantity of data
manageable, we did some crude filtering to remove some (but not all) vectors
that produced duplicate manifolds.

- Genus 2: We used the layered handlebody given by the isomorphism
        signature "eHuGabdes", and we enumerated all weight vectors up to
        total weight 40.
- Genus 3: We used the layered handlebody given by the isomorphism
        signature "hHbLbqiabegeti", and we enumerated all weight vectors up
        to total weight 20.

sig/ contains text files summarising the triangulations that we generated.
This is meant to be human-readable, while also being formatted in a way that
makes it relatively easy to work with the data programmatically. The data is
sorted into different files according to the genus g of the initial layered
handlebody, and the total weight w of the generated weight vectors. In
detail, the file named
    sig/genus-<g>-intersections-<w>-isoSigs.txt
contains a table of data sorted into the following columns:

- Weight Vector: This column lists vectors of total weight w.
- Iso Sig: This column contains the isomorphism signatures of the
        triangulations generated from each weight vector.
- Simplified Isosig: This column contains the isomorphism signatures obtained
        after simplifying the generated triangulations.

tri/ contains Regina data files summarising the triangulations that we
generated. This format contains slightly more information than the text
format, and is better-suited for exploring the data manually. As with the
text format, the data is sorted according to the genus g and the total weight
w. In detail, the file named
    tri/genus-<g>-intersections-<w>.rga
contains the following:

- For each vector of total weight w, there is a Container labelled with this
  vector.
- The first item in each Container is the triangulation generated from the
  corresponding vector.
- The second item in each Container is the corresponding simplified
  triangulation. If this simplified triangulation appears in Regina's census
  data, then it is labelled with the name of the triangulation (which, in
  particular, identifies the underlying 3-manifold).

widths/ contains text files summarising the combinatorial widths of the
triangulations that we generated. Again, the data is sorted according to the
genus g and the total weight w. In detail, the file named
    widths/prime-genus-<g>-<w>-Widths.txt
contains a table of data sorted into the following columns:

- Weight: This column lists vectors of total weight w.
- LHBCW: This column contains lower bounds on the cutwidths of the
        triangulations generated from each weight vector.
- SimCW: This column contains lower bounds on the cutwidths of the
        corresponding simplified triangulations.
- DiffCW: This column contains the differences between the estimated
        cutwidths in the previous two columns (positive if the estimate went
        down after simplification).
- LHBTW: This column contains the treewidths of the triangulations generated
        from each weight vector.
- SimTW: This column contains the treewidths of the corresponding simplified
        triangulations.
- DiffTW: This column contains the differences between the treewidths in the
        previous two columns (positive if the treewidth went down after
        simplification).
